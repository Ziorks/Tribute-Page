          Here's a timeline of Master Chief's life and adventures:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>2511</strong> - Born in Elysium City on the colony world of
            Eridanus II
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2525</strong> - Underwent the dangerous process of
            SPARTAN-II Augmentation Procedures that caused almost half of the
            Spartan candidates to die, or be physically disabled; John was one
            of 33 Spartans who made it through the process unscathed
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2552</strong> - The Covenant Fleet of Valiant Prudence

            <strong>2553</strong> - Lord Hood commissioned a memorial near Mount
            Kilimanjaro in Africa in honor of UNSC service members lost during
            the war
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2557</strong> - Nearly five years after John went into
            cryo-sleep, the aft half of the Forward Unto Dawn entered orbit
            above Requiem, a Forerunner shield world
          </li>
